                    <h3>Anansi Goes Fishing</h3>
                    <p> A Tale from West Africa Foolish Anansi thought he could trick a fisherman into doing his work for him. "Let's go fishing," he suggested. "Very well," said the fisherman, who was clever and quite wise to Anansi's tricks. "I'll make the nets and you can get tired for me." "Wait," said Anansi, "I'll make the nets and you can get tired for me!" Anansi made nets as his friend pretended to be tired. They caught four fish. The fisherman said, "Anansi, you take these. I'll take tomorrow's catch. It might be bigger." Greedily imagining the next day's catch, Anansi said, "No, you take these and I'll take tomorrow's fish." But the next day, the nets were rotting away and no fish were caught. The fisherman said, "Anansi, take these rotten nets to market. You can sell them for much money." When Anansi shouted, "Rotten nets for sale!" in the marketplace, people beat him with sticks. "Some partner you are," Anansi said to the fisherman as he rubbed his bruises. "I took the beatings. At least you could have taken the pain." Anansi never tried to trick the fisherman again!</p>

                    <h3> The Purse of Gold</h3>
                    <p> A beggar found a leather purse that someone had dropped in the marketplace. Opening it, he discovered that it contained 100 pieces of gold. Then he heard a merchant shout, "A reward! A reward to the one who finds my leather purse!" Being an honest man, the beggar came forward and handed the purse to the merchant saying, "Here is your purse. May I have the reward now?" "Reward?" scoffed the merchant, greedily counting his gold. "Why the purse I dropped had 200 pieces of gold in it. You've already stolen more than the reward! Go away or I'll tell the police." "I'm an honest man," said the beggar defiantly. "Let us take this matter to the court." In court the judge patiently listened to both sides of the story and said, "I believe you both. Justice is possible! Merchant, you stated that the purse you lost contained 200 pieces of gold. Well, that's a considerable cost. But, the purse this beggar found had only 100 pieces of gold. Therefore, it couldn't be the one you lost." And, with that, the judge gave the purse and all the gold to the beggar.</p>
