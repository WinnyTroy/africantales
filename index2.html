                    <p> There was once a man who had a beautiful cat. She was so loving that one day he wished out loud, "Dear Cat, if you were only a woman, I'd marry you!" Aphrodite, the goddess of love, heard his wish and changed the cat into a beautiful woman. The man and the cat woman were married and lived quite happily together until one night . . . The beautiful woman was sitting on her bed and into the room came a mouse. She crouched on her hands and knees, pounced on the mouse, and began to eat it, much to her husband's alarm! Aphrodite looked down from the clouds and, seeing this, turned the woman back into a cat. Aphrodite chuckled, "I can change the outer appearance of a creature, but to truly make a difference, I guess I must change its inner character first!"</p>
