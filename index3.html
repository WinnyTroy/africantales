                <h3>The Traveler & The Nut Tree</h3>
                <p>A traveler who stopped to rest under a nut tree noticed a huge pumpkin growing on a thin vine. "How foolish are the ways of nature," the traveler muttered. "If things were as they should be, this big, strong tree would hold the large pumpkins, and the spindly vine would hold the nuts. Now if I made the world, that is how I'd have done it!" At that moment, from high up in the tree, a small nut fell and hit him squarely on the head. Startled, he looked up into the branches and thought, "Forgive my arrogance! If it were a big pumpkin that fell out of the tree onto my head, it most certainly would have killed me!"</p>
